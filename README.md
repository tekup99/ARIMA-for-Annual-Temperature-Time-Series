ARIMA Model for Annual Temperature Forecasting
Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of annual average temperature data from 1900 to 2023, collected from thousands of weather stations across the United States. The goal is to forecast future temperature trends using the ARIMA model.

Methods
We applied the ARIMA(0,1,1) model to the time series data to predict future temperature trends. The model was chosen for its ability to handle non-stationary data by differencing. Model parameters were estimated, and diagnostic checks were performed to ensure the model's adequacy.

Results
The analysis indicates that future temperatures are expected to remain relatively stable around 53.8Â°F, with confidence intervals reflecting some variability. The ARIMA model provides a reasonable short-term forecast but does not account for external factors such as greenhouse gas emissions or natural climate events.
